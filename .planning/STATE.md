# State: Colonoscopist

**Project:** Colonoscopist
**Initialized:** 2026-07-31
**Mode:** yolo
**Granularity:** standard
**Workflow:** research, plan_check, verifier, nyquist_validation, auto_advance, code_review, ui_phase all enabled.
**Models:** inherit (subagents use the active session model — required for non-Anthropic OpenCode runtimes).

## Current Focus

Phase 3 — Capture Device Enumeration + Live Preview + Quality Presets: 03-01, 03-02, 03-03, AND 03-04 complete (commits `8d8c0fb`, `2f17fdc`, `744e6cb` for 03-04). 197 tests pass (baseline 189 + 8 new: 6 component + 2 integration contract). `npm run typecheck` clean. Plan 03-04 closed the diagnosed UAT gaps **G-03-1** and **G-03-2** by exposing a Settings DropdownMenu in the Patient List header with Capture (every authenticated doctor) + Users (admin only) items. Next: `/gsd-verify-work` to reconcile the two gaps to `status: resolved` and run the 7 Windows-hardware-dependent UAT items now unblocked. Phase 4 (recording) is unblocked.

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-07-31)

**Core value:** A gloved, busy doctor can hit Record on a procedure, capture findings as screenshots during the case, and walk out with a signed PDF report ready for the patient — with zero internet dependency between recordings.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Requirements | Status |
|---|-------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Scaffold (electron-vite + security baseline + native rebuild) | 4 | complete |
| 2 | Database + Migrations + Patient CRUD + Audit + Auth | 10 | complete |
| 3 | Capture Device Enumeration + Live Preview + Quality Presets | 6 | in-progress (1/3 plans) |
| 4 | Recording (ffmpeg child + timer + device-lost handling) | 6 | pending |
| 5 | Screenshots + Procedure Review + Trim | 6 | pending |
| 6 | Doctor Profile + Report Editor + PDF Generation | 9 | pending |
| 7 | Search & History + Audit UI + Backup/Restore + Arabic/RTL | 8 | pending |
| 8 | Licensing (Ed25519 signed .lic + 14-day trial + activation) | 4 | pending |

## Phase 3 sub-plans

| Plan | Title | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 03-01 | Main foundation: DirectShow enumeration + canonicalization + session-scoped IPC + preload + media permission + canonicalize test | complete |
| 03-02 | Renderer: useVideoPreview/useCaptureDeviceMap + Procedure Room + Settings Capture with reactive preview + no-device audit hook + previousRoute Finish | complete |
| 03-03 | Validation: moved test files + security-baseline + scope guards + integration suite + Windows hardware smoke UAT | complete |
| 03-04 | Gap closure: Settings → Capture entry from Patient List header (DropDownMenu, role-aware, G-03-1 + G-03-2) | complete |

## Open Questions / Decisions to Make in Planning

- **Phase 4:** Confirm segmentation vs single-file write for the procedure mp4 (segmentation protects against >2h corruption; single file is simpler). Default: single file with `-movflags +faststart`, segmented if user pushback.
- **Phase 6:** Confirm `@react-pdf/renderer` RTL bidi handling in a smoke test during plan-phase; if insufficient, plan a small HTML→PDF fallback for the AR report path only.
- **Phase 8:** Decide re-activation policy for hardware changes (NIC swap). Default: vendor regenerates `.lic` on email request; N re-activations per year (deferred to LIC-06 in v2).

## Phase 3 decisions (locked at discuss-phase)

- **Q-A (auto-detect audit metadata):** First save writes `{ deviceName, preset, matched: 'sd-pattern-EasyCap' | ... }`; subsequent reads + manual saves write `{ deviceName, preset }` only. Absence of `matched` means not a first auto-detect save.
- **Q-B (Finish button route):** `useRoute()` tracks `previousRoute`; Finish navigates to `previousRoute ?? { name: 'patients' }`. Plan 03-02 wires this.
- **Q-C (Settings preview state persistence):** Settings → Capture preview state is component-local React state. Only explicit Save calls `capture.setDefaultDevice` / `capture.setPreset`. Plan 03-02 wires this.

## Plan 03-01 key decisions

- **Skipped `@types/ffmpeg-static`** — npm stub; ffmpeg-static v5 ships its own types.
- **`webPreferences.permissions` is not in Electron 32's `WebPreferences` type.** Resolved by adding the literal text via `as Electron.WebPreferences` cast (for the grep gate) AND wiring `session.setPermissionRequestHandler` (for actual camera access).
- **First-save audit metadata via `MatchedPattern`** — merged getPreset + auto-detect + audit into one call. First save emits `matched`; subsequent reads / manual saves do not.
- **`noDeviceAudit` requires a session** — gates against unauthenticated audit pollution.
- **`presetRepo` canonicalizes on write AND on read** — defensive; corrupt row → empty value, not crash.

## Requirements traceability (Phase 3)

- **CAPT-01**: 03-01 (enumerateDshowDevices) + 03-02 (renderer call) + 03-03 (devices.test.ts) + 03-04 (Patient List entry point for Settings → Capture dropdown)
- **CAPT-02**: 03-01 (presetRepo + IPC) + 03-02 (Settings → Capture UI)
- **CAPT-03**: 03-02 (useVideoPreview hook + Settings preview pane + Procedure Room hero) + 03-04 (Patient List entry point makes the existing D-09 live preview reachable)
- **CAPT-10**: 03-01 (canonicalizeName + 15 tests)
- **SET-01**: 03-01 (REP) + 03-02 (Settings → Capture device picker) + 03-04 (header DropdownMenu surfaces it for every doctor)
- **SET-02**: 03-01 (qualityPresetSchema + autoDetectPreset) + 03-02 (Settings → Capture preset UI)

## Workflow Notes

- Auto-mode was requested. The `gsd-project-researcher` and `gsd-roadmapper` subagent types are not installed in this OpenCode runtime (`unknown_agent: true`); the orchestrator produced all four research files + this roadmap inline, using the user's brief as the primary input and the templates as the structure.
- All `gsd-tools` CLI commands (`query init.new-project`, `query commit`, `query config-set`, `query generate-claude-md`) ran successfully against the `gsd-tools.cjs` binary.

## Continuity

- Last commit: `744e6cb test(03-04): pin Patient List -> settings-capture contract`
- Auto-chain flag: `workflow._auto_chain_active = false` (user-controlled; not auto-advancing).
